<!--

Samples of how the XML structure will looks like.

All individual box nodes are nested inside a container node called boxes.

Each box can only have one type. The types are l, m, and s where l stands for large
m stands for medium, and s stands for small.

Every box nodes accept a time where the time is when the content specified inside
the box will begin.
